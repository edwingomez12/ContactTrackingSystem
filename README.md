This is a blazor application with SQLite for the database.
It is using basic authentication and authorization. 
When starting the application, navigate to the register section to create a user. Once you type in the detail it will ask you to confirm the 
user. It won't ask for a two step confirmation. You can just click on the confirm link.
Once a user is created, you'll be able to login and see prepoulated data in the candidates page. 
You can also add new candidates. This project has unit tests in to test the functionality.
